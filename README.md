# hello-world
The start of a new beginning
Hello! I am Arthur Robinzine. I am trying to learn to code so that I can possibly make a career out of it. I like making websites and learned my first coding (HTML) in high-school. I've been learning other things via other free websites and am glad to collaborate with anybody on here. Thank-you for reading and have a blessed day.
